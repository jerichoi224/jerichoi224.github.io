                        <p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Hey, You found a secret! Congratulations!!</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">You know, there's this old game back in Korea called Color Labyrinth, which, probably won't show up even if you google it since its like.. really old. Oh hey, yeah, I was right. For some reason the site is down. I don't know why but yeah... so sad...</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Anyways, the game was something like what you did with the "secret." Every page, there's a questions for you to solve and if you change the address to the correct text, you move on to the next level and so on. I just found this to be a really entertaining idea since you actually have to solve the question or riddle. Checking the source code won't help you since you have to figure out what the name of the html file is, and that doesn't really show up in the source code (Unless the questions was telling you to check the source code, with the answer located there)</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 1.5em;">Well, This website is still just a build in progress and a personal blog, so people probably won't find this any time soon. I'll probably slowly add hidden pages one by one, and one day, someone will maybe figure it out. Either way, they might have references not everyone knows, so this could end up in me just wasting time and nobody ever using it. So, Thanks for reading all this, and hope you enjoy your day. </p>
