## Concept

The game features two protagonists in two different storylines as they each make their way to the Wilderness, the site of a growing sinkhole that threatens to consume the planet. Players make progress by typing freeform commands to talk to NPCs, manipulate inventory, and traverse rooms.

## Story

A sinkhole has opened up in the Wilderness and threatens to consume the planet. Lore, a stoic college dropout searching for her life's purpose, and Kipp, a bold farmhand looking for adventure, begin journeys from different ends of the planet to the source of the cataclysm. In this minimalist text adventure, join these two as they discover their destinies are intertwined.

## Background

Wilderness is a game developed as a project from the Student Games Developer club in UVA during Fall of 2016. The game was developed in Python 3.5, and is a text-based adventure game playable in Windows.

## Role
My Role in this game was to develop a parser that would take the script text files written by the writers of the group and parse the script into a node structures so the game could use it. Additionally, I participated in packaging the game into executables.
