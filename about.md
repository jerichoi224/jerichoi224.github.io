<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Choi, and I'm a recent graduate from University 
of Virginia. I am continuing my studies and anticipating Masters degree in 
Computer Science on December of 2020. </p>

<p>I was born in Pittsburgh, PA but have been moving frequently between the 
United States, mostly living in Northern Virginia, and near Seoul. I lived 
almost half of my life in each country so I'm fluent in both English and 
Korean. I can also speak Japanese as well. </p>

<p>You can reach me at my email at dc9db@virginia.edu</p>
